# Raven Design System (RDS)

RDS, Carleton Universityâ€™s design system, is a living digital organism uniting campus wide teams around a common visual language.

Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore...

## Getting started

**Note**: instructions below are for working with the RDS Docs package. RDS design systems documentation can be found at https://ravendesignsystem.github.io/rds/

### Clone repo

Clone this repo https://github.com/ravendesignsystem/rds.git into your project directory.

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have composer, node and npm installed.

Check if they are installed and what version is installed. If either is not installed, use the links below to learn how.

* `composer --version` -- Read more about [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* `node --version` -- Read more about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* `npm --version` -- NPM is install as a part of Node.js

#### Install packages

Once the dependencies above are installed, run the commands below to install the required packages.

* `npm install` -- installs all the dependencies set in the package.json file
* `php composer.phar install` -- installs all the dependencies set in the composer.json file

## Running RDS Locally

To run RDS locally and watch all relevant files for changes use `npm run dev`.

The above command runs both the sculpin static site generator, [read more](https://sculpin.io) and the laravel mix watch task, [read more](https://laravel-mix.com) concurrently.

## Deployment

To deploy, terminate the above script and use `npm run prod`.

## Full docs
Further documentation on how to build the RDS docs is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/ravendesignsystem/rds/wiki/RDS-Docs).
