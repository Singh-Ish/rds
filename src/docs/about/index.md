The RDS design system was established to help Carleton University deliver a unified experience across its many web properties. The RDS design system provides a single source of truth for the university's UI and UX, uniting development teams across campus through a shared language that:
 
 * makes it easier for Carleton teams to prototype and implement designs and patterns.
 * creates consistency across the carleton.ca domain, which in turn will create a familiar user experience for all.
 * creates focus, clarity and an understanding across web and software development teams by documenting Carleton's design standards.
 
## A work in progress...
 
Design Systems are living documents and will never be complete. But if you are checking out this documentation at this time, you will find these docs very much incomplete, including with empty page stubs and broken links.
 
We are not in production with the system just yet. We are working hard to get there. Along the way this site and the RDS documentation will grow and become more complete.

Stay tuned.
