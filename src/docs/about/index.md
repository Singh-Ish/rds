[STUB] TODO - update this page

The RDS design system was established to help Carleton deliver a unified experience across all of its web properties. In addition to creating a consistent user experience, the project provides an opportunity to unite development teams across campus through a shared language. 
RDS' underlying systems connect all the required pieces together to:
 
 * make it easier for Carleton teams to prototype and implement designs without writing a bunch of new CSS.
 * create consistency across the carleton.ca domain, which in turn will create a familiar experience for all.
 * create focus, clarity and an understanding across the web development to unite Carleton's design standards.
