The RDS design system was established to help Carleton University deliver a unified experience across all of its many web properties. In addition to creating a consistent user experience, the project provides an opportunity to unite development teams across campus through a shared language. 

RDS' underlying systems connect all the required pieces together to:
 
 * make it easier for Carleton teams to prototype and implement designs without writing a bunch of new markup and CSS.
 * create consistency across the carleton.ca domain, which in turn will create a familiar user experience for all.
 * create focus, clarity and an understanding across the web development teams by documenting Carleton's design standards.
 
## A work in progress...
 
Design Systems are living documents and will never be complete. But if you are checking out this documentation at this time, you will find these docs very much incomplete, including with empty page stubs and broken links.
 
We are not in production with the system just yet. We are working hard to get there. Along the way this site and the RDS documentation will grow and become more complete.

Stay tuned.
