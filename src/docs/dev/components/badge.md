Badges are small, inline count and labeling components.

<span class="c-badge">5</span>

```html
<span class="c-badge">5</span>
```

<span class="c-badge">New</span>

```html

```

## Guidelines

- Keep strings used in badges short by limiting text or numbers to no more then 5 characters. Character counts exceeding this will be truncated and display an ellipsis.
- When it makes sense, abbreviate words to keep them short.
