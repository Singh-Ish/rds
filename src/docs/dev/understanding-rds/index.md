# Introduction

The RDS design system was established to help Carleton deliver a unified experience across all of its web properties. In addition to creating a consistent user experience, another goal was to unite development teams across campus through a shared language.

This section is intended to help developers better understand the core concepts behind the RDS system.

RDS makes it easier to prototype and implement designs without writing a ton of new CSS

the source of truth for our design system thus far has been Sass.

 Communicate updates more widely through team posts:
 Make the status of styles more obvious: with the refactor of many of our styles things were constantly changing, we needed to communicate that clearly so that people knew what was safe to use.

This year we’ve been moving our UI Kits into Figma for designers to create mockups and prototypes with. Figma is built on web technology which means we can make use of tooling we use for other design systems workflows, and avoid having to work around software specific to macOS. Figma’s new Styles feature lets us map system primitives like colors and typography to components, similar to how we do in code. Figma’s API makes it easier for us to integrate with other parts of our workflow and automate tasks, such as checking components in Figma against our components in code.






 
  
 
A successful Design Language will:
Focus: allow the designer to focus clearly on the project at hand rather then to be diverted by other distractions.
Clarity: allow the designer to think clearly about our design beliefs as well as the design constraints in place across the platform.
Confidence: allow the designer to have complete confidence in what they are designing and that it is inline with others in the team.
Consistency: create consistency across the product which in turn will create a secure, familiar experience across the platform.
Efficiency: create understanding across the teams, meaning less time consumed concentrating on the less important details.


The main goal of a design language is to create focus and clarity for designers. A design language is like any language. If there is any confusion it will cause a breakdown in communication.



“ Creating an underlaying language will unite our design philosophies and methodologies across our platform.”

Design language needs to be understood by all teams involved so that the project can progress holistically in a consistent way.

Consistency is one of the essential topics of user experience. Maintaining consistency in the big project is often a problem in itself.

 Terminology
 Various concepts are used by teams to create their preferred design standards.
 Functional pattern, Component: Reusable tangible elements. Buttons, form fields, navigation, etc.
 Perceptual pattern, Styles: This is more abstract than the functional pattern. It will emotionally enhance message perception. Color, typography, animation, etc.
 Pattern library: Documentation of functional and perceptual patterns.
 Style guide: Documentation of standards for using pattern library. This includes logo usage and space adjustments. It also includes examples of best practices, and information about the development process.
