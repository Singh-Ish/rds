The RDS Design System is Carleton's system for creating digital harmony across platforms. One of the systematic ways to guide our collective efforts is to insure everyone is speaking the same language. This section documents the key concepts and terminology used within RDS' underlying design language to create consistency across the system. 

While this section is a must read for RDS developers, we encourage content creators and site users to read on to get a better understanding and familiarity with the concepts that make up the RDS.

## The makeup of 





 
  
 
A successful Design Language will:
Focus: allow the designer to focus clearly on the project at hand rather then to be diverted by other distractions.
Clarity: allow the designer to think clearly about our design beliefs as well as the design constraints in place across the platform.
Confidence: allow the designer to have complete confidence in what they are designing and that it is inline with others in the team.
Consistency: create consistency across the product which in turn will create a secure, familiar experience across the platform.
Efficiency: create understanding across the teams, meaning less time consumed concentrating on the less important details.


The main goal of a design language is to create focus and clarity for designers. A design language is like any language. If there is any confusion it will cause a breakdown in communication.



“ Creating an underlaying language will unite our design philosophies and methodologies across our platform.”

Design language needs to be understood by all teams involved so that the project can progress holistically in a consistent way.

Consistency is one of the essential topics of user experience. Maintaining consistency in the big project is often a problem in itself.

 Terminology
 Various concepts are used by teams to create their preferred design standards.
 Functional pattern, Component: Reusable tangible elements. Buttons, form fields, navigation, etc.
 Perceptual pattern, Styles: This is more abstract than the functional pattern. It will emotionally enhance message perception. Color, typography, animation, etc.
 Pattern library: Documentation of functional and perceptual patterns.
 Style guide: Documentation of standards for using pattern library. This includes logo usage and space adjustments. It also includes examples of best practices, and information about the development process.
