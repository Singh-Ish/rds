Layouts are used to arrange Blocks and position them within page sections. If you are working on a one column page design, chances are a layout is not necessary as RDS blocks are designed to stack directly on top of each other. If you need to lay your blocks out in multiple columns, layouts are the means to do so. Layouts also used to set content breakpoints and determine which blocks are visible on different screen sizes.

Presently, there are only **Body Layouts available** as all Layouts only exist between the `<header>` and `<footer>` [sections](#).

RDS ships with the following layouts:

- [Single column layout](single-column)
- [Multi-column layout](multi-column)
- [Overlay layout](overlay)
