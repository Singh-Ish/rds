## Important public service announcement

If you are affiliated with Carleton, you can skip all of the technical overhead required to build your own RDS site, by using the [Carleton CMS service](https://carleton.ca/webservices/request-a-website/). RDS and all of its goodness is baked right into the free WordPress CMS service. Using the Carleton CMS service is by far the fastest and easiest way to get up and running with a new RDS website. By using this service, you can focus on your content and [Web Services](https://carleton.ca/webservices) will take care of hosting, security and all of the updates.

## Carleton themes: Quick start

If you are looking to setup a website that uses either the [Carleton CMS theme](#) or the [Framework theme](#), you should follow this [Quick start guide](#) for integrating existing Carleton themes.

## Getting started with custom themes

If you want to roll your own custom theme or extend one of the [two defaults themes](#), there are three main ways to get started with RDS:





Before getting started integrating RDS, your first decision should be chose which theme you want to use for your project. 
 
1. [Carleton CMS theme](#)
2. [Framework theme](#)
3. Roll your own [custom theme](#)



## 1. Use the Carleton CMS Service



## 2. Follow our Quick start guide for setting up our base themes

Use the [Quick start guide](#) to get started with a starter template and attach an RDS theme's hosted, compiled CSS and JS to your project.

For options 1 and 2, we recommend you start by reading the docs explaining the [Main conceoptds of RDS](#) followed by the section on [Custom theming](#).
