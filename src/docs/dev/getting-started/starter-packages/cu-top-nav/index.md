## Hello World

This starter kit was put together to help those learning RDS get going prototyping and experimenting with the project. We hope you find it a helpful in this regard.

This starter kit's template:

- use the [CU theme](#) with [top navigation](#) in the [Masthead block](#).
- use the hidden [Menu block](#) in the [dialogue section](#) for a mobile menu.
- examples of the [Content Block](#) in use with different background colour rows.

We set up a couple pages:

1. [Page using several blocks](blocks/)
2. [Page highlighting the layout](layout/) used in this starter.

Fire up your IDE and check out the source code of these straight-forward HTML pages to better understand RDS.

## Version

This starter kit is pulling CSS and JS from RDSv{{site.version}}. You can [check here](https://ravendesignsystem.github.io/rds/v/) to make sure it is the latest version.
