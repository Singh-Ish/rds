TODO: [CU theme: top nav](cu-top-nav/)

To get going even faster with templates, check out and download our Starter projects that contain skeleton examples of RDS in use.

## Install RDS with npm

The docs below assume you are familiar with [using npm](http://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/) and have [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

1. Install RDS in your project directory.

```js
npm install --save-dev @carleton/rds
```
RDS will require a Sass compiler and Autoprefixer for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

### npm starter projects

You can download the following npm starter projects to get started with everything you need to use RDS with modern build tools:

- RDS webpack starter (coming soon)
- RDS webpack / elenventy starter
