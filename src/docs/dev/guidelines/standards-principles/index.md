title: Design Principles and Coding Standards
---
While, development focused, the following principles and guidelines do rollup to RDS' overall [guiding principles](#). Anyone contributing to or developing with RDS should have a clear understanding of the principles and guidelines below.

## Design principles

Focus on accessibility first.
Reuse, reuse, reuse.
Design for flexibility.

Clarity - Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, understand, and act with confidence.
Consistency - Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem.

## General coding guidelines and standards

- Be transparent and add support with comments wherever needed.

##Contributing

TTS is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We expect everyone on the TTS team and everyone within TTS spaces, including contributors to our projects, to follow the TTS Code of Conduct.

Browser support

We’ve designed the Design System to support older and newer browsers through progressive enhancement. The current major version of the Design System (1.0) is designed to support the newest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 11 and up.

The next major release (2.0) will follow the 2% rule: we will officially support any browser above 2% usage as observed by analytics.usa.gov. Currently, this means that the Design System version 2.0 will support the newest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 11 and up.

Accessibility

The Design System also meets the WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines and conforms to the standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. We’re happy to answer questions about accessibility — email us for more information.

See browser support in the “Getting started: Developers” guidelines.
